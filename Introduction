Introduction :

In this project, We use Google Cloud services like Cloud IOT Core, Pub/Sub, Google Cloud Run to track the live temperature using an ESP32 Microcontroller and BME680 temperature sensor.
We use Arduino, VS Code (as code editor) with Platform IO extension to manage ESP32 & BME680 devices.
We use Golang metric converter services to get messages from Pub/Sub service and post it to Prometheus.
Prometheus acts as an input data source to Grafana.
We use Grafana dashboard as user end interface.
